# Welcome to the PyCondor documentation

[PyCondor](https://github.com/jrbourbeau/pycondor) (Python HTCondor) is a tool that helps build and submit HTCondor jobs in a straight-forward manner with minimal hassle.

## Motivation

[HTCondor](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) is a an open-source workload management system for high-throughput computing tasks developed at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. It is an incredibly useful and versatile tool. However, the process of submitting jobs to HTCondor, especially when there are inter-job dependencies, can quickly become both tedious and complex. PyCondor is a tool to help streamline this job submission process through a user-friendly API and built-in functionality to automate common tasks.
